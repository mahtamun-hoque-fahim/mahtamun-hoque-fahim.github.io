<h2 align="center">Forking this repo üéØ (important ‚ö†Ô∏è )</h2>

<p>Some people have asked me if they can use this code for their website, and the answer to that question is usually <b>yes, with appropriate credit</b>.

<p>I value keeping my site and its code open source, but as you all know, <b>plagiarism is bad</b>. It always hurts whenever I find that someone has copied and pasted my site without giving me a bit of credit. I spent a huge amount of time and effort to build and design this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! <br> <b>So, what I need to say is not to claim all of my efforts as your own bruv </b>.</p>
<p font-size="5px">[ Writing this kind of readme was an idea of <a href="https://brittanychiang.com/?ref=fahim.pages.dev" target="_blank">Brittany Chiang </a> ] </p>

<h5 align="center">And <b>yes</b>, you can always fork this repo.Use it whenever you want, Just give me the appropriate credit by attaching my GitHub link in the appropriate area of your website.</h5>
