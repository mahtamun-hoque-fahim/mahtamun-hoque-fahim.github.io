<h2 align="center">Stealing this repo 🎯 (important ⚠️ )</h2>

<p>Some people have asked me if they can use this code for their website, and the answer to that question is usually a big <u> <b>yes, with appropriate credit</b></u> .

<p>I value keeping my site and its code open source, but as you all know, <b>plagiarism is bad</b>. It always hurts whenever I find that someone has copied and pasted my site without giving me a bit of credit. I spent a huge amount of time and effort to build and design this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! <br> <b>So, what I need to say is not to claim all of my efforts as your own bruv </b>.</p>

<h5 align="center">And <b>yes</b>, you can always fork this repo.Use it whenever you want, Just give me the appropriate credit by end of your website.</h5>
